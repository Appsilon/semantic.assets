We have updated the title.

## Author comment

I understand that the package size exceeds CRAN's submission limit. The purpose of this submission is to reduce the size of the main package, shiny.semantic, by offloading all necessary assets.
This package now contains CSS and JS files that were previously accessible only through a CDN.
This modification ensures that these files are available even when the package is used in environments without internet access.
I kindly request the reviewer to consider an exception to the size limit and approve the package.
